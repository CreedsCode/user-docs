# What is TalentLayer ID?

Your TalentLayer ID is the core of your identity when interacting with TalentLayer-integrated marketplaces and freelancing tools. Your TalentLayer ID is associated with reviews that people you have worked with leave for you, and represents your overall, work-based reputation in the ecosystem.

## What is a TalentLayer ID?

Your TalentLayer ID is a soul-bound ERC-721 NFT. Soul-bound NFTs can not be moved from your original wallet unless you qualify for emergency recovery.

In this section, weâ€™ll explore key concepts to understand your TalentLayer ID, from how your ID is created to how to handle emergency account recovery.



## Role-Agnostic IDs

Unlike other freelancing platforms, you do not need a seperate account to hire freelancers and be hired by others.&#x20;

TalentLayer IDs are designed in a way that allows every identity to both hire and be hired. Either party can initiate the creation of a job on TalentLayer Indie, and invite the counter-party to participate.

## TalentLayer ID Handles

Your TalentLayer ID Handle is a unique string of characters and numbers that you can choose when you create your TalentLayer ID. This handle is how others can search for your reputation.&#x20;

You can have a maximum of 10 characters in your TalentLayer ID.
