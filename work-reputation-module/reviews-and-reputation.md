# ðŸ‘‹ Reviews and Reputation

TalentLayer IDâ€™s build their reputation over time through receiving Reviews from counter-parties; people youâ€™ve worked with either as a hirer or a person being hired.

## **Reviews**

When a review is left for you by a counter-party, a Review is created. This is a soul-bound NFT that is associated with your TalentLayer ID.

## **Reviews During Account Recovery**

If you initiate an emergency account recovery, your reputation element NFTs will follow your TalentLayer ID to your new wallet.

**Good to know:** Right now, there is no way to remove a review after it has been written. TalentLayer is working on a method for reviews that both parties agree should be removed to be deleted.&#x20;
