# PlatformID

Platform ID is the way in which access control is implemented on TalentLayer. It gives exclusive rights for platform ID holders to read and write to the TalentLayer backend for performing functionality such as [minting TalentLayerIDs](../../technical-guides/smart-contracts/talentlayerid.sol.md#minting), creating [Services](jobs-and-proposals/services.md), [Proposals](jobs-and-proposals/proposals.md), and more.

More information on how it is implemented can be found in our [guide on the TalentLayer PlatformID smart contract](../../technical-guides/smart-contracts/talentlayerplatformid.sol.md).
