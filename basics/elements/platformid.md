# PlatformID

## Why DO I Need a Platform ID?

Platform ID is the way in which access control is implemented on TalentLayer. It gives exclusive rights for platform ID holders to read and write to the TalentLayer backend for performing functionality such as [minting TalentLayerIDs](../../technical-guides/smart-contracts/talentlayerid.sol.md#minting), creating [Services](broken-reference), [Proposals](broken-reference), and more.

## How Do I Get a Platform ID?

Right now while TalentLayer is in Alpha, Platform IDs are minted by the TalentLayer Core team and sent to platforms.&#x20;

Please request a Platform ID by emailing labs@talentlayer.org.

## How Does It Work?

More information on how it is implemented can be found in our [guide on the TalentLayer PlatformID smart contract](../../technical-guides/smart-contracts/talentlayerplatformid.sol.md).
