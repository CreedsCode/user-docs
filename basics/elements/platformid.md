# PlatformID

## What is a Platform ID?

Platform ID is the way in which access control is implemented on TalentLayer. It gives exclusive rights for platform ID holders to read and write to the TalentLayer backend for performing functionality such as minting TalentLayerIDs, creating Services, Proposals, and more.

## How Do I Get a Platform ID?

Right now while TalentLayer is in Alpha, Platform IDs are minted by the TalentLayer Core team and sent to platforms upon request.&#x20;

Please request a Platform ID by emailing [labs@talentlayer.org](mailto:labs@talentlayer.org).

## How Can I Configure Fees With My Platform ID?&#x20;
