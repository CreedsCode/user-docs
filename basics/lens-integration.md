# 🌱 Lens Integration

TalentLayer has partnered with Lens, the decentralized social graph, to connect our protocols; enabling platforms building on Lens to offer work-related offerings like job posts, proposals, escrow payments and more, and platforms building on TalentLayer to let users display their social history alongside their work reputations.&#x20;

## Why TalentLayer and 🌱 Lens?

We have the same open-source and interoperable vision for work that Lens has for social media! We want to see a world where all users own their data and work platforms benefit from user sharing.&#x20;

So, it’s only natural to team up 🤝.

TalentLayer empowers builders in the Lens community to add freelance and work marketplace functionality to their social apps! PLUS: Work marketplace builders can add social feeds to their apps!&#x20;

All that’s left is to build the link between us ❤️connecting TalentLayer work IDs with Lens handles and building some SDK tools to help platforms integrate united profiles!

There is a clear benefit to hirers on work platforms to see verified social feeds, and there’s value in being able to showcase your fave work history updates on your professional social feeds.
