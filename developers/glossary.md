### Key Concepts

**TalentLayer:** TalentLayer is composable, decentralized, open-source infrastructure for talent markets; allowing anyone to easily build interoperable gig marketplaces. TalentLayer functions as an interoperability layer that allows you to grow one reputation by completing work on many job platforms.

**Work sovereignty:** Having control over how you make income to the extent that your earning ability is resilient amidst outside forces. This is made possible when one’s reputation, built over time, is trusted by enough people to make finding new work easy.

**TalentLayer Reputation System:** Includes TalentLayer ID systems and Reputation ID systems.

**Unified Jobs Repository / TalentLayer Jobs System:** A unified repository for jobs posted on any TalentLayer-integrated marketplaces.

**Escrow and Dispute Resolution System:** A Kleros-based system for escrow and handling disputes, native to TalentLayer.

### Identity Elements

**TalentLayer ID:** TalentLayer ID is a work identity that allows you to own and grow one reputation across many gig marketplaces. TalentLayer IDs are ERC 721 NFTs that live in your crypto wallet; this means your reputation is self-custodied by you and lives separately from the marketplaces you find work on. TalentLayer IDs are “soul-bound” in that they can not leave the originating wallet unless a recovery is initiated.

**Reputation ID (or Review NFT):** A Reputation NFT is a ERC 721 NFT that is associated with your TalentLayer ID. New Reputation NFTs are minted whenever you complete a job (as a hirer or a freelancer) on TalentLayer. They include information about the job completed and a review from the other party. You can have an unlimited number of Reputation NFTs. Hirers leave Reputation NFTs for freelancers and freelancers leave Reputation NFTs for hirers - a mutual-review system.
