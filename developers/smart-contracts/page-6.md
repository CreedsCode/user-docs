# Job Registry

**JobRegistry.sol** is the smart contract that creates an instance of a Job and associates Proposals with that job as they are submitted. Jobs and Proposals are not minted as NFTs - rather, their data is stored in an on-chain registry within the smart contract. Jobs and Proposals can be deleted or updated easily.&#x20;
