# Service Registry

**ServiceRegistry.sol** is the smart contract that creates an instance of a Services and associates Proposals with that service as they are submitted. Services and Proposals are not minted as NFTs - rather, their data is stored in an on-chain registry within the smart contract. Services and Proposals can be deleted or updated easily.
