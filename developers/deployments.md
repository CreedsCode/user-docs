# Deployments

All the latest deployment addresses can be found in the [talentlayer-id-contracts repository](https://github.com/TalentLayer/talentlayer-id-contracts#talentlayer).

Proof of Humanity does not currently support Gnosis Chain and Goerli testnet. We've set up a mock POH contract for now. If you want to add a spoof identity to our mock contract for your testing purposes, please reach out to us on Twitter @TalentLayer.

Proof of Humanity has an official deployment on ETH Kovan Testnet. Resources for interacting with spoof identities can be found here.
