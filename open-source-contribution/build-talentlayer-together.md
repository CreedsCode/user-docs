# Build TalentLayer Together

TalentLayer is maintained by a fast-growing community of open-source contributors, let by the **Core Team**. All team members have been freelancers, most have hired freelancers, and some have built gig marketplaces. Together, they’re a united front building a better way to do work.

* We represent 9+ nationalities and even more languages
* We currently have 15 active people contributing; led by our Core Team
* To date we’ve had 17+ people contribute to our open-source development and biz ops to get TalentLayer where it is today
