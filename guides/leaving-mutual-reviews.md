# Leaving mutual reviews

After you have initiated a job and your counter-party has agreed to the the terms, you are able to initiate a review.&#x20;

You may only submit a review after you have remitted/received the payment to the counter-party, because a transaction must be submitted along with the review.

## Initiate a review

1. **Select a Job:** Log into TalentLayer Indie, and go to the Admin Center. Click “Initiate a New Review”.
2. **Initiate a Review:** Using the Initiate New Review form, you can input a Rating, Review, and the Transaction associated with the job that was completed.
3. **Counter-party Settles Review:** The counter-party that on the job will now be able to view the new review invite in their Admin Center by clicking the View Pending Reviews button. They can leave a review for you.
