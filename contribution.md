# 😁 Contribution

TalentLayer is run by a scrappy community of open-source devs and passionate builders. We've been growing TalentLayer since July, 2022 and are always seeking more contributors to co-create with! If you are passionate about work sovereignty and want to build the future of work together, get in touch! We have new contributors joining each month.&#x20;
