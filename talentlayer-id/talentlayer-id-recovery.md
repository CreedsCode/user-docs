# TalentLayer ID Recovery

Account recovery allows you to request that your TalentLayer ID be associated with a new wallet, and verify that you own the new wallet via a cryptographic proof.

## Initiate a Recovery

In order to initiate a TalentLayer ID recovery, you will need to have three things:

1. Your TalentLayer ID handle
2. The original wallet address you minted your ID into
3. The Recovery Password that was provided to you when you created your TalentLayer Id.

If you do not have access to your Recovery Password, there is unfortunately not any way to recover your TalentLayer ID.

**Good to know:** Currently, TalentLayer ID recovery is only possible for users who associate a Proof of Humanity identity with their TalentLayer ID during account creation.
