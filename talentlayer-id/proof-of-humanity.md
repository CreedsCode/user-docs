# Proof of Humanity

Proof of Humanity is a web-of-trust system that uses reverse Turing tests and dispute resolution to create a sybil-proof list of humans. TalentLayer users can optionally associate their TalentLayer IDs with their identity on Proof of Humanity during the TalentLayer ID creation process.

Currently, only members who verify their human-hood with Proof of Humanity are able to participate in emergency ID recovery. This is to prevent the recovery system from being used by bad actors to transfer their TalentLayer ID to another personâ€™s wallet.

**Good to know:** Proof of Humanity has no affiliation with TalentLayer. It is an independent third-party identity system.
