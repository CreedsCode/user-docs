# Reviews and Reputation

TalentLayer ID’s build their reputation over time through receiving reviews from counter-parties; people you’ve worked with either as a hirer or a person being hired.

## **Reputation Elements**

When a review is left for you by a counter-party, a Reputation Element is created. This is a soul-bound NFT that is associated with your TalentLayer ID.

## **Reputation Elements During Account Recovery**

If you initiate an emergency account recovery, your reputation element NFTs will follow your TalentLayer ID to your new wallet.

**Good to know:** Right now, there is no way to remove a review after it has been written. TalentLayer will eventually roll out a method for reviews that both parties agree should be removed to be deleted.&#x20;
