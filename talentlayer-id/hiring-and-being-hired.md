# Hiring & Being Hired

Unlike other freelancing platforms, you do not need a seperate account to hire freelancers and be hired by others.&#x20;

TalentLayer IDs are designed in a way that allows every identity to both hire and be hired. Either party can initiate the creation of a job on TalentLayer Indie, and invite the counter-party to participate.
