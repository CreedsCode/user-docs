# TalentLayer Wiki Guide

The TalentLayer Wiki exists to aggregate questions, problems, and solutions as we encounter them as a growing dev team! It is mainly an internal resource for the TalentLayer Core team and open-source contributors. &#x20;

## Engineering Problem Solving Workflow

When you encounter a problem or question, go through the following steps!

1. Google for the solution.
2. Search for the answer in the TalentLayer Engineering Wiki.
3. Ask Martin or Romain for help.
4. Document what you've learned in the Engineering Wiki to help everyone else find the solution fast next time!

## Make a Wiki Entry

Copy the Wiki Template!&#x20;

{% content-ref url="wiki-template.md" %}
[wiki-template.md](wiki-template.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Making an Entry With CLI
