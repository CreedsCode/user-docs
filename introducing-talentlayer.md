## Is TalentLayer A Good Fit For Your Platform? <a href="#is-talentlayer-a-good-fit-for-your-platform" id="is-talentlayer-a-good-fit-for-your-platform"></a>

Are you looking to build platform like freelance marketplaces, bounty platforms, hackathon platforms, gig marketplaces, or something similar? TalentLayer is composable, decentralized, open-source infrastructure for labor markets; allowing anyone to easily build interoperable gig marketplaces. It is designed to empower workers to own their own reputation and access jobs without limitation. TalentLayer is optimized for a broad range of two-sided “labor platforms”, software platforms where users can complete services in exchange for payment. These platforms usually have a few things in common:

1. Hirers post tasks or other service engagements to the platform
2. Users complete work in exchange for payment
3. By completing work on the platform, users can build a reputation

TalentLayer offers a variety of tools to help labor platforms empower their users.

## Understanding TalentLayer Core's Components <a href="#understanding-talentlayer-cores-components" id="understanding-talentlayer-cores-components"></a>

TalentLayer Core is composed of the following key modules:

* ​[TalentLayer Universal Work Reputation Module ](https://docs.talentlayer.org/work-reputation-module)\[live 07/24/2022]
  * ​[TalentLayer ID System](https://docs.talentlayer.org/work-reputation-module/what-is-talentlayer-id)​
  * ​[TalentLayer Review System](https://docs.talentlayer.org/work-reputation-module/reviews-and-reputation)​
* ​[TalentLayer Universal Work Facilitation Module](https://docs.talentlayer.org/work-facilitation-module) \[live 10/18/2022]
  * ​[TalentLayer Universal Job & Proposal System](https://docs.talentlayer.org/work-facilitation-module/jobs-and-proposals)​
  * [​TalentLayer Escrow & Dispute System](technical-guides/smart-contracts/escrow-and-dispute/)​

TalentLayer creates a paradigm shift in how freelance marketplaces operate by creating a universal reputation system and jobs repository that any marketplace can tap into. Users maintain one self-owned reputation across many marketplaces. Marketplaces that build on TalentLayer receive rewards by onboarding talent and jobs.

### Create A New DAPP in 5 Minutes <a href="#explore-the-indie-demo-dapp" id="explore-the-indie-demo-dapp"></a>

Indie is an open-source fork-able codebase that is available for marketplaces and other platforms integrating with [TalentLayer](https://docs.talentlayer.org/) to borrow from and use to get inspired. Indie lays the groundwork for what will eventually become the TalentLayer SDK.
