# Creating your first job

## Create a job

1. **Visit Admin Center**: Log into TalentLayer Indie, and go to the Admin Center.
2. **Create Job:** Use the Job Creation Form to input Job Title, Job Description, Keywords, whether you are hiring or being hired, and the TalentLayer ID Handle of the counter-party.
3. **Counter-party Accepts Job:** The counter-party that you invite to the job will now be able to view the new job invite in their Admin Center by clicking the View New Jobs button. They can accept or reject the job invite. If they reject the job invite, the job is invalidated.

**Good to know:** TalentLayer Indie does not offer payment remittance facilitation or verification at this point. TalentLayer Beta will include an escrow system, nativly integrated with the TalentLayer Identity System.
