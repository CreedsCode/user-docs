### An Identity That Moves With You

With the TalentLayer ID system, you own and grow one reputation across many job marketplaces.

TalentLayer IDs are NFTs that live in your crypto wallet; this means your reputation is self-custodied by you and lives separately from the marketplaces you find work on. Use your reputation how you like, where you like.

### Powerful Signals

The most powerful signal that employers look at to determine if someone will meet their needs is a personâ€™s prior work history. TalentLayer IDs are built up over time through completing real-world and provable jobs on TalentLayer-integrated marketplaces and tools. TalentLayer IDs become a trusted source for verifying credibility and building a merit-based reputation.

### Uncensored Access to Jobs

TalentLayer provides uncensorable access to jobs; use your reputation on any TalentLayer integrated marketplace or even build your own tools that integrate directy with TalentLayer.

For example:

_An invoicing solution that prompts your clients to leave a recommendation on your TalentLayer ID_

_A personal search engine for jobs posted to TalentLayer_
