TalentLayer Core is composable, decentralized, open-source infrastructure for talent markets; allowing anyone to easily build interoperable gig marketplaces. It is designed to empower workers to own their own reputation and to access and provide services without limitation.

TalentLayer Core is composed of the following key modules:

  * [TalentLayer Escrow & Dispute System](work-facilitation-module/escrow-and-dispute-system.md)

TalentLayer creates a paradigm shift in how freelance marketplaces operate by creating a universal reputation system and services repository that any marketplace can tap into. Users maintain one self-owned reputation across many marketplaces. Marketplaces that build on TalentLayer receive rewards by onboarding talent and services.

## Integrating TalentLayer

## Is TalentLayer A Good Fit For Your Platform?

Do you have an existing platform such as a freelance marketplace, bounty platform, hackathon platform, or something similar? Are you looking to build one of these platforms?

TalentLayer is composable, decentralized, open-source infrastructure for talent markets; allowing anyone to easily build interoperable gig marketplaces. It is designed to empower workers to own their own reputation and access and provide services without limitation.

TalentLayer is optimized for a broad range of two-sided ‚Äúlabor platforms‚Äù, software platforms where users can complete services in exchange for payment. These platforms usually have a few things in common:

1. Hirers post tasks or other service engagements to the platform
2. Users complete work in exchange for payment
3. By completing work on the platform, users can build a reputation

## TalentLayer‚Äôs Future Token Economics

As a decentralized protocol, TalentLayer will have an ecosystem token, incentives system, and fees system. These systems are not present in our Alpha. We expect to implement a V1 of our incentives and fees systems over the course of Winter 2022. Please see our Economic Model Summary to better understand our thinking around tokenomics and fees. All information provided in the document below is not final - we will be working closely with integration partners to ensure fees and incentives align with their needs.
