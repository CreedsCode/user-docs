# Network Support

TalentLayer is multi-chain. We have deployments across various networks. Supported Networks is not intended to be a comprehensive list of what networks we intend to support. Network support is governed by demand from builders - if you need to build on a certain network please reach out to our team.&#x20;

## Supported Networks&#x20;

| Network         | Status            | Type    | Features\*                                                          |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gnosis          | Live              | Mainnet | All features except Kleros Arbitration                              |
| Ethereum Goerli | Live              | Testnet | All features except TalentLayer ID Recovery                         |
| Ethereum Kovan  | Live              | Testnet | All features except subgraph querying                               |

We intend to over the next 6-12 month deploy to additional chains including but not limited to Aurora, Polygon, Polkadot Moonbeam.&#x20;

We intend to partner with organizations to co-create TalentLayer conracts outside of the EVM space, with deployment planning in progress for NEAR and Stacks.&#x20;

\*Features that are listed as not supported on specific chains are due to certain third-party technologies not being deployed to those chains. For example, Kleros only supports Ethereum and not other EVM chains.&#x20;
