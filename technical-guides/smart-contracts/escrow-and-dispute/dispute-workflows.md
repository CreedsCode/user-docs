# Dispute Workflows

## Terminology

* **Dispute:** a disagreement between two (or more) parties
* **Ruling:** a decision taken about the resolution of a dispute
* **Arbitrator:** the entity that has the power to give a ruling
* **Appeal:** an opportunity for a party to try to contest the current (but not final) ruling
* **Evidence:** material provided by a party to support his/her viewpoint

## Dispute Workflow

1. Two parties disagree on something.
2. They can't reach an agreement. One party submits a request for creating a _dispute_.
3. Each party submits _evidence_ to show their viewpoint and give reasons why they believe they are right
4. An _arbitrator_ reviews the supporting materials, decides who’s right and gives a **ruling**
5. A period opens in which the parties can _appeal_ the _ruling_ taken by the _arbitrator_
6. The _arbitrator_ considers the _appeals_ and after the appeal period is over takes a final decision, entering the **ruling** (more on this later)

Example: dispute on the execution of a service

1. Alice has hired Bob on HireVibes to create a website for her business. The money is locked in an escrow and will be released to Bob once the job is done and meets Alice’s expectations.
2. When Bob is done with the website, Alice believes that the job was not done sufficiently for Bob to be paid. They disagree on this, so Alice decides to open a dispute.
3. Both Alice and Bob submit materials to support their point of view
4. HireVibes’ customer support reviews the materials and believes that Alice is right
5. Bob can appeal HireVibes’ decision, giving extra information
6. HireVibes’ still believes that Alice is right and takes a final decision. The escrow is automatically released to Alice

**Who is The Arbitrator?** Arbitrators can be either centralized (e.g. the customer support of the platform) or decentralized (e.g. Kleros’ network of jurors). TalentLayer supports two options for Dispute Resolution; Kleros and centralized dispute resolution, which is managed by the platform posting the job.&#x20;
