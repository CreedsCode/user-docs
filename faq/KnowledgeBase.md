## Can I transfer my tlid?

If you have a TalentLayer ID, you can transfer it to another user, as long as you have not used it for any activity such as creating a service or a proposal on a marketplace. Once you have used your TalentLayer ID to complete a job, it becomes locked to your account (SBD) and cannot be transferred.

## How to be in the whitelist?

Unfortunatly the whitelist is currently closed, you will need to wait until the 14th of April when the Public minting will be opened.

## How much it cost?

## If you have a technical issue during the minting process

Firstly, please ensure that you have enough MATIC in your wallet to cover the gas fees required to mint your TalentLayerID If you do not have enough MATIC, you may need to purchase more on a supported exchange or transfer it from another wallet.

If you have sufficient MATIC, we suggest you try the following technical checks to help resolve the issue:
• Clear your browser cache and cookies, or try using a different browser to see if the issue persists.
• Check your internet connection and ensure that it is stable and not experiencing any interruptions.
• If you are using Metamask please reinitialize the account in setting > advanced parameter > reinitialize your account (don't worry it won't delete anything)
• Double-check that you have entered all the required information correctly when filling out the minting form.

If none of the above suggestions work, please fill out this quick form so we can help you out ASAP ? Thanks a lot !
