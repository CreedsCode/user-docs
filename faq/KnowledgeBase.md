> # TalentLayer ID

## How to claim your tlid?

Please visite the following link to claim your tlid: [https://claim.talentlayer.org/](https://claim.talentlayer.org/)

## Can I transfer my tlid?

If you have a TalentLayer ID, you can transfer it to another user, as long as you have not used it for any activity such as creating a service or a proposal on a marketplace. Once you have used your TalentLayer ID to complete a job, it becomes locked to your account (SBD) and cannot be transferred.

## How to be in the whitelist?

Unfortunatly the whitelist is currently closed, you will need to wait until the 14th of April when the Public minting will be opened.

## How much it cost?

Please find all the minting price on this link [https://claim.talentlayer.org/](https://claim.talentlayer.org/)
