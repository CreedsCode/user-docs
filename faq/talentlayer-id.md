## - Can I transfer my Tlid?

If you have a TalentLayer ID, **you can transfer** it to another user, as long as **you have not used it for any activity on the protocol** such as creating a service or a proposal on a marketplace. Once you have used your TalentLayer ID to do an activity, it becomes locked to your account (as a soul-bound token) and cannot be transferred.

## - Can anyone mint a Tlid

Yes the minting is public, you just need a Wallet on Polygon whit MATIC.

## - How much does a Tlid cost?

Please find all the minting prices here on the minting page [https://claim.talentlayer.org/](https://claim.talentlayer.org/)

## - I have a technical issue during the minting process

Firstly, please ensure that you have enough MATIC in your wallet to cover the gas fees required to mint your TalentLayerID.

&#x20;If you do not have enough MATIC, you may need to purchase more on a supported exchange or transfer it from another wallet.

If you have sufficient MATIC, we suggest you try the following technical checks to help resolve the issue:&#x20;

• Clear your browser cache and cookies, or try using a different browser to see if the issue persists.&#x20;

• Check your internet connection and ensure that it is stable and not experiencing any interruptions.&#x20;

• If you are using Metamask please reinitialize the account in setting > advanced parameter > reinitialize your account (don't worry it won't delete anything)&#x20;

• Double-check that you have entered all the required information correctly when filling out the minting form.
