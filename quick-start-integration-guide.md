## We're Here to Help

Since TalentLayer Core is currently in **Alpha,** we recommend reaching out to the team on Twitter @TalentLayer or via email labs@talentlayer.org before integrating directly with TalentLayerâ€™s interoperable reputation and services systems.

We are happy to help you:

1. Understand how to implement TalentLayer on your platform: Every platform is a little different, and we want to know how we can best make our tech stack as composable as possible. By helping you, we learn too!
2. Deploy TalentLayer on your platformâ€™s native EVM chain: TalentLayer aims to be a cross-chain platform, and are in the process of spinning up implementations of our Alpha release on multiple EVM chains.

Happy building!
